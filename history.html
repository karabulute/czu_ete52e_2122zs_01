        An ancient late Bronze Age fortified settlement was found in Drahovice. 
        A Slavic settlement on the site of Karlovy Vary is documented by findings in Tašovice and Sedlec. 
        People lived in close proximity to the site as far back as the 13th century and they must have been aware of the curative effects of thermal springs.

        From the end of the 12th century to the early 13th century, German settlers from nearby German-speaking regions came as settlers, 
        craftsmen and miners to develop the region's economy. Eventually, Karlovy Vary/Karlsbad became a town with a German-speaking population.
    
        In 1325, Obora, a village in the today's city area, was mentioned. Karlovy Vary as a small spa settlement was founded most likely around 1349. 
        According to a legend, Charles IV organized an expedition into the forests surrounding modern-day Karlovy Vary during a stay in Loket. 
        It is said that his party once discovered a hot spring by accident, and thanks to the water from the spring, Charles IV healed his injured leg. 
        On the site of a spring, he established a spa mentioned as in dem warmen Bade bey dem Elbogen in German, or Horké Lázně u Lokte (Hot Spas at the Loket). 
        The location was subsequently named "Karlovy Vary" after the emperor. Charles IV granted the town privileges on 14 August 1370. 
        Earlier settlements can also be found on the outskirts of today's city.  </p>

    <h2>Modern times</h2>
        <p>
            An important political event took place in the city in 1819, with the issuing of the Carlsbad Decrees following a conference there. 
            Initiated by the Austrian Minister of State Klemens von Metternich, the decrees were intended to implement anti-liberal censorship 
            within the German Confederation.

            Due to publications produced by physicians such as David Becher and Josef von Löschner, 
            the city developed into a spa resort in the 19th century and was visited by many members of European aristocracy 
            as well as celebrities from many fields of endeavour. It became even more popular after railway lines were completed from Prague to Cheb in 1870.
            
            The number of visitors rose from 134 families in the 1756 season to 26,000 guests annually at the end of the 19th century. 
            By 1911, that figure had reached 71,000, but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 greatly disrupted the tourism on which the city depended.
            
            At the end of World War I in 1918, the large German-speaking population of Bohemia was incorporated into the new state of 
            Czechoslovakia in accordance with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). As a result, the German-speaking majority of Karlovy Vary protested. 
            A demonstration on 4 March 1919 passed peacefully, but later that month, 
            six demonstrators were killed by Czech troops after a demonstration became unruly.
            
            According to the 1930 census, the city was home to 23,901 inhabitants – 20,856 were of German ethnicity, 
            1,446 of Czechoslovak ethnicity (Czech or Slovak), 243 of Jewish ethnicity, 19 of Hungarian ethnicity and 12 of Polish ethnicity.
            
            In 1938, the majority German-speaking areas of Czechoslovakia, known as the Sudetenland, became part of Nazi Germany according to the terms 
            of the Munich Agreement. After World War II, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the vast majority of the people of the city 
            were forcibly expelled because of their German ethnicity. In accordance with the Beneš decrees, their property was confiscated without compensation.
            
            Since the end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, 
            the presence of Russian businesses in Karlovy Vary has steadily increased.
