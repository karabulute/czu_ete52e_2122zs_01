                    century, when Anton Deiml built a lusthaus called the Saxon Hall at a relatively large distance from
                    the city center (the construction was financed by the Saxon Elector August II). A few years later,
                    the city had a so-called Czech Hall built in the neighborhood . In the second half of the 18th
                    century, the confectioner Johann Georg Pupp bought the Czech Hall, but his grandchildren only
                    managed to unite the Czech and Saxon Halls. In the 1990s, it was rebuilt into a hotel complex under
                    the leadership of Fellner and Helmer.

                    a restaurant and a beer hall was built at the beginning of the 20th century. After the signing of
                    the Munich Agreement, the association's activities were terminated and the hotel was converted into
                    apartments for the Reich Railways. The activities of the association have not been resumed.

                    the hotel underwent a complicated privatization, which continued until 2010 in a lawsuit between the
                    new owners and the city. Extensive reconstruction took place in 2011–2015. [21]Now it serves the
