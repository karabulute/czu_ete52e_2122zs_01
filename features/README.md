# Bootstrap
### The official Bootstrap website describes it as:
* “The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web.”

### Here’s what that means in plainer terms:
* Bootstrap is a giant collection of handy, reusable bits of code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s also a frontend development framework that enables developers and designers to quickly build fully responsive websites.

Essentially, Bootstrap saves you from writing lots of CSS code, giving you more time to spend on designing webpages.

### Advantages:
* Its responsive grid
    * No more spending hours coding your own grid—Bootstrap comes with its own grid system predefined.
* Its responsive images
    * Bootstrap comes with its own code for automatically resizing images based on the current screen size. Just add the .img-responsive class to your images, and the predefined CSS rules take care of the rest.
* Its components
   * Navigation bars
   * Dropdowns
   * Progress bars
   * Thumbnails

As you’ve probably noticed by now, Bootstrap is a powerful tool that allows a developer to get up and running quickly and painlessly. It makes it easy to integrate many great features that enrich a user’s interaction with the web without having to code them from scratch.

* A way of thinking about data
* Design principles for formats
* Adapted to current behaviors and usage patterns
* Highly correlated with semantic XHTML

The microformats principles:

* Design for humans first, machines second
* Reuse building blocks from widely adopted standards
